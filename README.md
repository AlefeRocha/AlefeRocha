### Hello, I'm Alefe ðŸ‘‹

I'm a former advertising/design professional with a passion for coding! I'm currently in the midst of a career transition and have previously worked as a junior developer.

My focus is on backend development, where I've knowledge Javascript, Typescript, Flutter, and SQL, along with various libraries and frameworks such as Node.Js, Nest.Js, Express.Js, Docker, Hasura, and others. Lately, I've been working on small projects to enhance my skills, and I'm also taking courses from Rocketseat and Alura to further my knowledge.

**ðŸš€ let's code!**
